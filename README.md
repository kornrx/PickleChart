## 📄 Paper Trading Engine

A simulated trading stack that runs on the same order-flow signals the chart
draws. It is **paper only**: no exchange credentials are read, no API keys are
stored, and no real orders are ever placed.

### Quick start

```bash
# terminal 1 — collector, strategy, paper broker
npm run paper

# terminal 2 — the chart UI (open the "Paper" tab in the right panel)
npm run dev
```

Once ticks have been collected, replay them through the same code:

```bash
npm run backtest
npm run backtest -- --symbols=BTCUSDT --from=2026-09-24T00:00:00Z
```

Run the broker and risk assertions:

```bash
npm run selftest
```

### How it fits together

```
Binance WS ──┬─► MarketContext ──► Strategy ──► RiskManager ──► PaperBroker
             │   (LiquidityEngine,   (signal)     (sizing,        (simulated
             │    CandleAggregator,               kill switch)     fills)
             │    TradeClusterEngine)                  │
             └─► SQLite (ticks, book snapshots, candles, orders, equity)
                                                       │
                              UI "Paper" tab ◄── WebSocket :8787 ──┘
```

The server imports `LiquidityEngine`, `CandleAggregator` and
`TradeClusterEngine` directly from `src/services`, so the strategy reacts to
exactly what the chart renders. Live and replay share one `TradingEngine`;
only the tick source differs, and nothing in the decision path reads the wall
clock — replay drives the clock from the tape.

| File | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| `server/index.ts` | Live collector, feeds, WebSocket telemetry, control commands |
| `server/marketContext.ts` | Per-symbol analytical state, shared by live and backtest |
| `server/tradingEngine.ts` | Data → strategy → risk → broker, plus journalling |
| `server/paperBroker.ts` | Simulated fills, brackets, fees, position and PnL accounting |
| `server/riskManager.ts` | Position sizing, daily loss limit, drawdown kill switch |
| `server/strategy/sweepReversal.ts` | Reference order-flow strategy |
| `server/backtest.ts` | Replays stored ticks and prints a performance report |
| `server/db.ts` | SQLite journal (`node:sqlite`, no native build needed) |

### Fill model

Deliberately pessimistic, so paper results are not flattered:

- Market orders **walk the visible depth** for a size-weighted price and pay the taker fee.
- A stop that gaps fills at the **gapped price**, not at the stop level.
- A resting limit fills only once an aggressor **actually trades through it**, and pays the maker fee.
- A position can never be stopped out on its own entry tick.

It still differs from live trading: the book is a 20-level snapshot, queue
position is not modelled, and there is no funding, partial-fill or latency
simulation.

### Risk controls

| Control | Default | Behaviour |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Risk per trade | 0.5% of equity | Size derived from the stop distance |
| Max leverage | 5x | Caps notional when the stop is tight |
| Max open positions | 2 | Across all symbols |
| Daily loss limit | 3% | Blocks new entries, resets at UTC midnight |
| Drawdown kill switch | 15% | Latches for the run; cleared only by hand |
| Cooldown after a loss | 60s | Per symbol |

Override without editing code: `PC_EQUITY`, `PC_RISK_PER_TRADE`,
`PC_MAX_DAILY_LOSS`, `PC_MAX_DRAWDOWN`, `PC_SYMBOLS`, `PC_DB`, `PC_WS_PORT`.

### The reference strategy

`sweep-reversal` looks for an aggressor running price through a resting pool of
stops, failing to follow through, and the opposite side taking control: a swept
liquidity pool, a reclaim of the swept level, an aggressor-delta flip, and a
supporting book imbalance. The stop goes beyond the sweep extreme and the
target is the nearest un-swept pool in the direction of travel.

**No claim is made that it is profitable.** It exists as a worked, testable
example of consuming the order-flow signals — measure it with the backtester
and replace it with your own rules. Implement the `Strategy` interface in
`server/strategy/types.ts` and swap it in `server/index.ts`.

### Before anything touches real money

Paper results are not live results. If you ever extend this to live execution,
the API key belongs in a server-side `.env` that is never imported by the Vite
bundle — anything under `src/` ships to the browser. Start on Binance testnet,
and size down hard.
